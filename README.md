FAQ:

Why did you create a moderation script essentially for free?<br>

Good moderation tools should be easily accessible to the community.<br>
They should not only be of high quality, but they should adhere to the user experience and they should be easy to configure.<br>
The user experience is what I'm trying to optimize, and that is a promise I make with the SmartTips feature.<br>

Will I get in trouble for sharing this version of the script?<br>

Simple answer, I don't anticipate it will; the script that would be on the Minehut Market will utilize MongoSK databases with an option for Discord integration.<br>
Simple loophole around Minehut's rule.<br>

Purchasing the script from the Minehut Market will allow you to be able to beta test any developer builds that may arise.<br>
This can involve early versions of any new features that may arise in either the database version or the nondatabase version.<br>

May I utilize your code?<br>

You have every right to utilize the code in this GitHub.
There may be a small TOS.
